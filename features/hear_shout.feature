Feature: Hear Shout

  Users can hear shouts from people nearby

  Rules:
  - Shout range is 1000m
  - Network connectivity required
  - Messages don't have signatures for now

  Questions:
  - How do we represent the network connectivity rule? This is the server!
  - Should we hear ourself? Can that actually be used as confirmation?
